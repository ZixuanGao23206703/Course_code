Apology and Clarification Regarding File Upload Issue

Dear professor,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to extend my sincere apologies for a recent oversight on my part regarding the file upload for github assignment. Unfortunately, I mistakenly uploaded the files to the 'main' branch instead of my designated subfolder 'Zixuan Gao23206703'.

To provide you with a comprehensive overview of the situation, I have included detailed information in the attached files: 'gitlog_output.txt' and 'gitstatus.txt'. These documents outline the timeline and specifics of both the erroneous upload to 'main' and the subsequent correction in my subfolder.

For your convenience, I have also attached screenshots depicting the initial upload to 'main' and the subsequent upload to my designated subfolder. This should provide a visual representation of the situation.

I have now rectified the error by re-uploading all the required files to the correct location, ensuring that they are readily accessible for your review. To facilitate a better understanding of the upload process, I have included the updated 'gitlog_output_updated.txt' and 'gitstatus_updated.txt' files in this communication.

Once again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and I appreciate your understanding in this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or if additional clarification is needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
